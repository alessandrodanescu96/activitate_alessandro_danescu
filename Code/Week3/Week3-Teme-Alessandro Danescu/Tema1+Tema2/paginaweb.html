                                After the Voice, I started to work on my own music, finally i was able to write the 
                                song Multumesc, made by Alexandru Anghel, Vlad Brancoveanu and Alessandro Danescu.

                                The idea of the song was inspired by daily thoughts, that we don't have time to
                                be thankful for everything that you achieved. To be happy with the small things, to be 
                                proud of who we are and to be greatful.

                            <h3>Alessandro Danescu shocked the coaches Vocea României: "I never imagined that he is a man who sings"...</h3>
                            <p>
                                On Friday evening, Alessandro Danescu turned all four chairs performing the song "I'm no good" by Amy Winehouse.
                                Alessandro Dănescu (23 years old) is a student in Bucharest, at the Polytechnic, majoring in Aerospace Engineering.
                                He discovered his musical talent in the fifth grade, when his music teacher told him he had a musical ear. 
                                He says he inherited his passion for music from his grandparents - his grandfather played the flute and his
                                grandmother had a very beautiful voice.
